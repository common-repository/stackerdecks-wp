== Description ==

= What are Stackerdecks? =
Stackerdecks are distributable slideshows and listicles that directly support the use of Tweets, posts from Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest, Vines, YouTube, Soundcloud and Spotify songs, memes, animated GIFs, blog posts, product pages, and images (attribution included) from most sites with much more to come.

If the content is publicly viewable, it can be added to Stackerdecks.

Stackerdecks Native Embedded (free) is our ad-supported solution for publishing Stackerdecks on your site. The native state of Stackerdecks Embedded includes our logo, a single display advertisement, and a content discovery block.


Stackerdecks Enterprise Embedded is a powerful option for brands and ad-supported publishers to both customize and monetize their Stackerdecks. With our Enterprise Embedded subscription, each press of next on your published Stackerdecks measure as a page viewed and can also optionally refresh any advertising unit on a page, resulting in exponential improvement in revenue as well as deeper, actionable insights into audience engagement.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Stackerdecks.com account to use Stackerdecks WP? =

Yes. It is super simple to join. One click with your Facebook or Twitter account.

= Do I need to build content in order to add Stackerdecks to my Wordpress posts? =

No. There are thousands of existing Stackerdecks. Simply find some that you like and add them to Collections of your creation. Then they will be available for you to embed in the plugin. We do however encourage your to build your own Stackerdecks as it is super fun and super easy with our Chrome extension, Safari extension, or the Stackit Bookmarklet.
